        <h1>Broken Clock</h1>
        <p>On the wall in my house <br>
        Is a BROKEN clock <br>
        It works like a regular clock <br>
        But it’s missing the hour hand <br>
        <br>
        It must be hard being a broken clock <br>
        You try your best but something is wrong <br>
        A piece of you will always be missing <br>
        And until you get it back <br>
        You’re <b>WORTHLESS</b> <br>
        <br>
        I’d try fixing this clock<br>
        But the repair shop is open 3⁰⁰-3³⁰<br>
        And I have no clock to tell me when that is<br>
        <b>CURSE THIS VICIOUS CYCLE</b><br>
        <br>
        Is there any hope for the clock?<br>
        Is there any hope<br>
        <br>
        For me?</p>
