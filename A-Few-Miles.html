        <h1>A Few Miles in Search of Mother</h1>
        <h2>Original by Ilanit</h2>
        <p>In his soul<br>
        Like the oceans’ call<br>
        The heart of Marco is calling<br>
        He is going down, is going down<br>
        To that same old beach<br>
        It's the beach where Mom<br>
        Was stolen from him<br>
        On that day<br>
        Of the “celebration”<br>
        <br>
        They all say she has died<br>
        But in his soul he simply knows<br>
        Who can argue, who can fight<br>
        Against someone's soul?<br>
        <br>
        So he'll claw, punch and bite<br>
        With what's left of his might<br>
        Hoping that someone out there truly cares<br>
        That his mother's still alive in there<br>
        <br>
        He cares not of your words<br>
        He doesn't want your swords<br>
        Cause all he want is mommy back with him
