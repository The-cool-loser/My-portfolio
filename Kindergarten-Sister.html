        When I was young I had an older sister<br>
        She was nice, she liked a thrilling tale<br>
        She calmed me down and told me not to worry<br>
        For she promised to protect me well<br>
        That night I slept as if I were a fawn still<br>
        Knowing she will always have my back<br>
        <br>
        If I fell down<br>
        <br>
        Then the day I distinctly remember<br>
        My dad, Rudolph told me to sit down<br>
        I was naive, could not tell what had happened<br>
        But right then I asked him “when is Dess”<br>
        He told me something I can’t bear repeating<br>
        But suffice to say that in a way<br>
        <br>
        My sis fell down<br>
        <br>
        Then at next year, a spelling bee<br>
        They asked me to spell her name<br>
        I could not bear to think so I simply just lost<br>
        The winner than went bezerk, started bragging for years to come<br>
        That he was way smarter than I<br>
        Even though he’s not<br>
        <br>
        Now again my Dad is in a checkup<br>
        And for now it’s simply me and mom<br>
        We don’t really need to worry this time<br>
        But we just can’t bear to be alone<br>
        <br>
        But in this world, where everything is different<br>
        They show me how powerful I am<br>
        So I’m face to face with weird creatures<br>
        And this time it’s them who’re falling done<br>
        <br>
        Every death and every freeze<br>
        Is making me more strong<br>
        Now I know how it feels<br>
        At the side of success<br>
        So I cast a few spells<br>
        On many a monsters<br>
        And everything’s perfect at last
         </p>
