            One Too Many
        </video>
        <p>
       It’s a beautiful day outside<br>
Birds are singing<br>
Flowers are blooming<br>
On days like this<br>
Kids like you<br>
SHOULD BE BURNING IN HELL<br>
<br>
So everyone I’ve loved<br>
You have killed easily<br>
Well tonight I will fight<br>
To avenge my fallen peers<br>
<br>
Not afraid, not of you<br>
And I’m not letting you get through<br>
Pure evil, hateful soul<br>
D’you have any self control?<br>
<br>
Don’t answer me yet<br>
I’m not gonna forger<br>
And you’re gonna regret<br>
All the pain that you’ve caused<br>
<br>
And the dust on your hands<br>
Will never wash off your head<br>
And you’re gonna regret<br>
What I tell you, you’ve had<br>
<br>
One too many kills (kills), one too many slays (slays)<br>
One too many wrongs feeling strong ‘til this song<br>
Came to give you a taste (taste), Standing face to face (face)<br>
I have no fear so I’m here to face you<br>
Who had one too many (hey, hey)<br>
'Cause you’ve had one too many (hey, hey)<br>
One too many, oh<br>
One too many<br>
<br>
Dodge me all you can<br>
Eventually you’ll understand<br>
I’m willing to fight ‘til night<br>
I am showing you my might<br>
<br>
I know you’ll probably understand<br>
We could’ve been such awesome friends<br>
If you find it in your heart<br>
Get dunked on, too late for that<br>
<br>
Thought I want peace<br>
With you, who did all of this<br>
You were given a chance<br>
And now I’m on for revenge<br>
<br>
For my cool, fallen bro<br>
Who didn’t want to be foe<br>
I will not let you go<br>
You won’t get free, two<br>
<br>
One too many kills (kills), one too many slays (slays)<br>
One too many wrongs feeling strong ‘til this song<br>
Came to give you a taste (taste), Standing face to face (face)<br>
I have no fear so I’m here to face you<br>
Who had one too many (hey, hey)<br>
Yes, you've had one too many (hey, hey)<br>
One too many<br>
Chances I fear, this will end right here<br>
Could be me, could be you, someone will die once I’m through<br>
<br>
You’re one heck of a deal<br>
But I’m not easy to kill<br>
And I won’t give up until<br>
You will leave us alone<br>
'Cause if you're messing with me<br>
I'll give you something to see<br>
So now for the final punch<br>
And I will not let you dodge<br>
<br>
One too many kills (kills), one too many slays (slays)<br>
One too many wrongs feeling strong ‘til this song<br>
Came to give you a taste (taste), Standing face to face (face)<br>
I have no fear so I’m here to face you<br>
<br>
'Cause you’ve had One too many kills (kills), one too many slays (slays)<br>
One too many wrongs feeling strong ‘til this song<br>
Came to give you a taste (taste), Standing face to face (face)<br>
I have no fear so I’m here to face you<br>
Who had one too many (hey, hey)<br>
Who had one too many (hey, hey)<br>
Who had one too many (hey, hey)<br>
One too many, oh<br>
So, guess that’s it, uh? Just don’t say I didn’t warn you. Welp, I’m going to Grillbys. Papyrus, do you want anything?
