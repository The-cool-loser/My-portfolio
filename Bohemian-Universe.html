        <p>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        I’m so excited now<br>
        I’ve got a colony<br>
        Want to go visit<br>
        But that would be the end of me<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pearl</b><br>
        Diamond of Mine, if I may suggest a plan<br>
        Lie you’re a quartz rock, act like part of the game<br>
        Pretend you’re<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink and Pearl</b><br>
        Just a rock like the rest, working hard for the best<br>
        Nothing that’ll happen will ever be linked back to Pink<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        To Pink<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        My Pearl, it’s beautiful<br>
        All the flowers blooming here, all the faces, all the cheer<br>
        My Pearl, life’s here in the sun<br>
        Until we’ll go and throw it all away<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pearl</b><br>
        Diamond? Oooh?<br>

        <b>Pink</b><br>
        Pearl, I’m having second thoughts<br>
        I think we need to do something this instant<br>
        We must fight, we must fight, to withdraw from this disaster<br>
        <br> 
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        Oh Stars, these warriors<br>
        They made more vivid life, a more free less livid life<br>
        <br>
        <b>Garnet</b><br>
        Who am I? Do you know me? What’s going on?<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        You’re just something really powerful and true<br>
        Pearl, listen here<br>
        
        <b>Garnet</b><br>
        What is going on here?<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        I won’t let her die<br>
        I must defend this being with all my might<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        Hey, fellow Quartz, our diamond is corrupt<br> 
        And we might need to fight for the rights of this planet<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pearl</b><br>
        This world killing empress won’t control the likes of me<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        I’m Rose Quartz<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pearl</b><br>
        Ownless Pearl<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        We are fearless<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pearl</b><br>
        We’ll prevail<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink, Garnet and Pearl</b><br>
        For a world of change and love<br>
        <br>
        <b>All 3</b><br>
        We’re here to fight<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        Gee, this Rose Quartz gem’s really a toughy<br>
        <br>
        <b>Blue</b><br>
        She’s just a traitor fighting against your rights<br>
        Show everyone what the likes of her get<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        Are you sure, I don’t know? Seems I should give up<br>

        <b>Blue</b>
        How shameful! No, we won’t let you give up!<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        I’ll give up<br>
        <br>
        <b>Blue</b><br>
        How shameful! No, you will not give up!<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        I’ll give up<br>
        <br>
        <b>Blue</b><br>
        How shameful! No, you will not give up!<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        I’ll give up<br>
        <br>
        <b>Blue</b><br>
        You will not give up<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        I’ll Give up<br>
        <br>
        <b>Blue</b><br>
        You will not give up. Never ever will you<br>
        <br>
        <b>Blue and Pink</b><br>
        Just give up<br>
        <br>
        <b>Blue</b><br>
        No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pearl</b><br>
        Oh my Diamond, oh my Diamond, are you sure about this plan?<br>
        <br>
        <b>Pink</b><br>
        Why, I sure hope I’m not gonna be shattered soon<br>
        I said soon<br>
        (your cue)<br>
        <br>
        <b>Blue</b><br>
        So you think you can kill her and come out unscathed<br>
        So you want to keep living while you misbehave<br>
        Oh, Starlings, you don’t know what you’re starting<br>
        Prepare for a war, prepare for a massive cracking<br>
        <br>
        <b>Steven</b><br>
        Nothing, on the surface<br>
        Is the thing it seemed<br>
        So why would it matter?<br>
        So why did it matter to me?<br>
        <br>
        <b>Everyone</b><br>
        Anyways, this song blows.
