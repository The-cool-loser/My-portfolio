        <h1>Basic in Behavior</h1>
        <h2>Original by OR3O</h2>
        <p>Every day for this whole year<br>
        We are stuck inside this dungeon<br>
        We're not free but want to be<br>
        Wishing it was somehow easy<br>
        Inside of these tunnels<br>
        That no one leaves no matter what<br>
        As all days melt into each other<br>
        Stay put and try not suffer<br>
        <br>
        We all are trying hard to<br>
        Hold on to hope that they’ll do<br>
        Everything that is possible<br>
        To ensure we escape from this hole<br>
        If we don't want to a death wish<br>
        We better do what they wish<br>
        Even though life is tough<br>
        They think spirit is enough<br>
        <br>
        This is how they live their lives<br>
        Hoping there is someway they can escape<br>
        And I'm here wondering If one day<br>
        They'll finally be free from this cage<br>
        I'm sure by now they have the feeling<br>
        That nobody at home gives a damn<br>
        What's with this state? So many problems<br>
        Don't go insane<br>
        <br>
        Waiting inside the square<br>
        Our families must be going crazy<br>
        We must follow every order<br>
        If we want to have it easy<br>
        They're always listening<br>
        And making sure this isn't over<br>
        All mistake are gonna lead<br>
        To yet another form of torture<br>

        Don't think about it too much<br>
        Nobody has a magic touch<br>
        We will just have to be a bit patient<br>
        Make the pain feel a little less potent<br>
        Accept that you cannot go<br>
        And this is now your brand new home<br>
        Who here needs to be free?<br>
        It is just a luxury<br>
        <br>
        This is how they live their lives<br>
        Hoping there is someway they can escape<br>
        And I'm here wondering If one day<br>
        They'll finally be free from this cage<br>
        I'm sure by now they have the feeling<br>
        That nobody at home gives a damn<br>
        What's with this state? So many problems<br>
        <br>
        Ben Gvir is dumb<br>
        And Ohana gives me some comfort<br>
        Tali’s overzealous<br>
        The King's a nudist<br>
        Smotrich is stingy<br>
        We all are trying to keep our cool<br>
        Gotta keep calm and carry on the luggage<br> 
        <br>
        Count every day of the war<br>
        Tell myself that this is gonna be okay<br>
        Can't understand what’s going on here<br>
        Is there any place here that's somehow safe?<br>
        I'm pushed around with all the pressure<br>
        To be here where I don't feel okay<br>
        There's gotta be some sort of method<br>
        To ease the pain<br>
         </p>
