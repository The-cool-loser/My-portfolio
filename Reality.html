<b>Monika (DDLC)</b><br>
Stop, I have been looking everywhere, No matter what I’m trying, I cannot get to reality<br>
<br>
<b>Sayori (DDLC)</b><br>
And now it’s me who’s in control, look how the wheel has been rolled<br>
<br>
<b>Monika</b><br>
You’re gonna end up dying<br>
<br>
<b>Sayori</b><br>
Dammit, where is reality? Oui?<br>
<br>
<b>Rick (Rick and Morty)</b><br>
We’ve got to f—-ing turn, this way is way too long<br>
<br>
<b>Bill Cypher (Gravity Falls)</b><br>
If I’m with Sir portal here then something have went wrong<br>
<br>
<b>Morty (Rick and Morty)</b><br>
Oh, gees, can everybody here simply just get along?<br>
<br>
<b>Chara</b><br>
Enough with this peaceful crap, it’s time to pump this song<br>
<br>
<b>Frisk</b><br>
We are our of water, let’s reset and try again<br>
<br>
<b>Chara</b><br>
Our one classification is that we’re a real pain<br>
<br>
<b>Kris</b><br>
If you asked me I’d say you’re 0 out of 10<br>
<br>
<b>Lancer</b><br>
I’m not that good with numbers, is it bad or is it bien?<br>
<br>
<b>Binky</b><br>
All you people think that I am done, but more actually begins the real fun<br>
<br>
<b>Chikn</b><br>
You’re so materialistic, come out and have a run. <br>
Or simply get out off the limo and come enjoy the sun<br>
<br>
<b>Binky</b><br>
Sauna<br>
<br>
<b>Grace</b>
Damn, I thought I knew what’s going on, but I’m now reassessing<br>
what I know about reality<br>
<br>
<b>Collector</b><br>
I just wanted to play a game, and yet a villain I’ve became<br>
<br>
<b>Grace</b><br>
Sounds a lot like my case here<br>
<br>
<b>Collector</b><br>
Tell me, who's seen the guy that trapped me just 50 years ago?<br>
<br>
<b>Gumball</b><br>
You all seem a little tense and worried, learn to be more fierce.<br>
When you’re a child my age you can better face your fears<br>
<br>
<b>Darwin</b><br>
That’s why I say to you to watch our show and have some cheers<br>
and here to our movie that we will never make appear<br>
<br>
<b>Monika</b><br>
You stupid brats are ruining this occasion<br>
<br>
<b>Sayori</b><br>
That’s an incredibly strong and painful accusation<br>
<br>
<b>Grace</b><br>
Poor thing will never learn the truths of this location<br>
<br>
<b>Simon</b><br>
It’s all quite fine, the fire in this pit quite calms the tension<br>
<br>
<b>All</b>
Stop, we’re stuck in here, please get a lift.<br>
<br> No matter how we’re trying, we cannot fix this reality.
If once again the story starts<br>
Then I am breaking this apart<br>
<br>
<b>Sayori</b><br>
I will not keep on dying, I must just get to reality<br>
