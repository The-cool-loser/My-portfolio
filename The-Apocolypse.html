        <h1>The Apocalypse</h1>
        <p>It doesn't matter how it happened<br>
        Doesn't matter who’s to blame<br>
        Because their guilt won't do jack shit<br>
        For those who die from the flames<br>
        It doesn't matter how it happened<br>
        Cus what people really care<br>
        Is can there loved ones ever ever be spared from<br>
        <br>
        The Apocalypse<br>
        Yes, everything’s ablaze<br>
        It’s the Apocalypse<br>
        And now life is just a phase<br>
        In the Apocalypse<br>
        We need someone really strong<br>
        Someone who will show us<br>
        What we need to get along<br>
        In this apocalypse<br>
        <br>
        Some of us get to see it ending<br>
        That assuming that it will<br>
        But not all of us will know if<br>
        We can survive it until<br>
        But if I won't see it ending<br>
        Leave a note for me to know<br>
        That it's gonna be okay now for those of you down below<br>
        <br>
        Past the Apocalypse<br>

        And now life is just a phase<br>
        In the Apocalypse<br>
        We need someone really strong<br>
        Someone who will show us<br>
        What we need to get along<br>
        In this apocalypse<br>
        <br>
        So let us all go free tonight<br>
        As long as the day is young<br>
        Those of us who’re left behind<br>
        Let's hope they see the send<br>
        So let us send a prayer tonight<br>
        As long as the day is young<br>
