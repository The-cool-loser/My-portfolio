        <h1>Entity Unknown</h1>
        <h2>Original by Disney</h2>
        <p>Mustn't touch it, so I won't<br> 
        I don't want chaos, I simply don't<br> 
        Though it's awfully tempting this is just the way things are<br>
        And by tempting fate I'm never going to get far, <br>
        <br>
        It's just a rock<br>
        It isn't worthy of my thought<br>
        And all those secret magic spells<br>
        I really shouldn't want<br>
        <br>
        Everyone who cares for me will probably just cry<br>
        I'm sorry, odd non-jasper, I’m not giving this a try<br>
        I wanna be accepted, and trusted and beloved<br>
        And I don't want to mess up it all just to have<br>
        <br>
        Entity unknown<br>
        Entity unknown<br>
        Entity unknown<br>

        Must it be hard?<br>
        These thoughts are making me insane<br>
        And a part of me knows that it is gonna cause some pain<br>
        But the risk is tempting, it is so hard to unsee<br>
        I always knew that I'm not what I'm meant to be.<br>

        All my life was filled with illness, and this rock might be the cure<br>
        Maybe fate did not just bring me to secure<br>
        <br>
        Entity unknown?<br>
        Entity unknown<br>
        Entity unknown<br>
        <br>
        No one’s in here<br>
        This is my chance<br>
        This is showtime<br>
        So I must dance<br>
        <br>
        Finally got it<br>
        I know this is wrong<br>
        But I’m so glad I've used<br>
        Entity unknown<br>
