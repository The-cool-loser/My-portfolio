        <p>
        I know you might think we’re a team here<br>
Although it’s unclear to me why<br>
I do all these things cause it’s funny<br>
So why would I bother to try?<br>
I know that I shared a lot with you<br>
And that is a pain in my neck<br>
But I don’t wanna get closer<br>
I won’t share my feelings and heck<br>
<br>
I don’t know how else I can say it<br>
I don’t give a darn about squat<br>
I don’t have some hidden emotion<br>
‘Cause who’d even care about that?<br>
To me you all are playthings<br>
Fish swimming into my hook<br>
There is nothing more to me<br>
So please don’t look<br>
<br>
I must be clear and concise here<br>
I wouldn’t care if you abstract<br>
I promise you I’m not lying<br>
I don’t care at all, that’s the facts<br>
If you met ones who abstracted<br>
You’d know they’re not pleasant folk<br>
Now can you please go away now<br>
I won’t continue to talk<br>
<br>
I don’t know how else I can say it<br>
I don’t give a darn about squat<br>
I don’t have some hidden emotion<br>
‘Cause who’d even care about that?<br>
To me you all are playthings<br>
Fish swimming into my hook<br>
There is nothing more to me<br>
So please don’t look<br>
<br>
So now here you go with assumptions<br>
Just since I refused to fight back<br>
You probably think I adore you<br>
Well, this might just set you on track<br>
If I ever seemed to be caring<br>
Or acting as if I adore<br>
It was all meant from the get go<br>
To make this confession hurt more<br>
<br>
I don’t know how else I can say it<br>
I don’t give a darn about squat<br>
I don’t have some hidden emotion<br>
‘Cause who’d even care about that?<br>
To me you all are playthings<br>
Fish swimming into my hook<br>
There is nothing more to me<br>
So please don’t look<br>
<br>
And now all alone in the mirror<br>
And I feel a bit stiff and intense<br>
I think I might fall any minute<br>
And I cannot bear this suspence<br>
I think that I might be abstracting<br>
I don’t know what it’s about <br>
I think my chit-chat with Pomni<br>
Has literally taken me out<br>
