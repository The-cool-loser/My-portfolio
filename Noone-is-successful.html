        <h1>No one is Successful</h1>
        <p>Life is like the Earth, always spinning around itself<br>
        And You try to get the sunlight in the time that you have left<br>
        But as your life keep rotating you just come to the conclusion<br>
        That wanting to succeed is simply wanting a delusion<br>
        <br>
        Noone is successful<br>
        The famous or the rich<br>
        Everything is painful<br>
        Because life is quite a bitch<br>
        Everyone's unhappy with their lot in life<br>
        So why is there such jealousy across all humankind<br>
        <br>
        You always look ahead towards the next thing you can do<br>
        And once you do it, you look forwards to what you can get to<br>
        Because greed is never satisfied, and getting used is easy<br>
        Yet even I believe that what I'm singing here is cheesy<br>
        <br>
        Noone is successful<br>
        The famous or the rich<br>
        Everything is painful<br>
        Because life is quite a bitch<br>
        Everyone's unhappy with their lot in life<br>
        So why is there such jealousy across all humankind<br>

        you why don't we look around<br>
        At what we did by now<br>
        Before we take the next step<br>
        Say thanks we've climbed so far<br>
        And I don't say it's simple<br>
        But if we don't try to do it<br>
        Then nothingâ€™s worth the time<br>
        There's really not much to it<br>
        <br>
        Noone is successful<br>
        The famous or the rich<br>
        Everything is painful<br>
        Because life is quite a bitch<br>
        Everyone's unhappy with their lot in life<br>
        So why is there such jealousy across all humankind<br>
