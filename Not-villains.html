        We are not really villains, no no no<br>
        We are not really villains<br>

        <b class="names">Flowey (Undertale)</b><br>
        Cause<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Monika (DDLC)</b><br>
        We were inside the club<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Flowey</b><br>
        We’re in the world above<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Monika</b><br>
        When at last I see him, my small link to the physical world<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Flowey</b><br>
        Then they attacked us with swords<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Monika</b><br>
        Couldn’t get close, so I had to, of course<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Flowey</b><br>
        Kill them<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Monika</b><br>
        You’re telling your story or am I?<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Flowey</b><br>
        Oh, did I interrupt your whine?<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Monika</b><br>
        I have merely changed their code<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Flowey</b><br>
        I would soon cower<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Monika</b><br>
        Causing all of them to just implode<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Flowey</b><br>
        Become a murderous flower<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Monika</b><br>
        I anticipated a reward<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Flowey</b><br>
        Oh, well, suck for you, but get this through<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Monika and Flowey</b><br>
        We are not really villains, no no no<br>
        We are not really villains<br>

        Hey, I was having fun, at last the world became my plaything<br>
        I no longer had to make up deals or even say things<br>
        But us eldritch horrors aren’t allowed to feel joy<br>
        Oy, oy, oy<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Queen Chrysalis (My Little Pony)</b><br>
        I just wanted to take care of the changelings<br>
        And identity theft was the thing I thought change things<br>
        It worked for a while, then my kingdom was destroyed<br>
        So I don’t play coy<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">White Diamond (Steven Universe)</b><br>
        Wanted to see our empire expand<br>
        And this “free will” thing, I didn’t understand<br>
        But that’s long ago, and now I’m more grown<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Monika, Flowey, Bill, Chrysalis and White</b><br>
        We are not really villains, no no no<br>

        I wanted to kill all witches, who did not?<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Simon (Infinity Train)</b><br>
        I suddenly saw her turn on all that we thought<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Roy (DHMIS)</b><br>
        And who the hell are you to tell me what my boy should be taught?<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Belos, Simon and Roy</b><br>
        You call us bad but we just did what we had<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Sara Berry</b><br>
        I was told that my victory dance would be etched in the mind of the school<br>
        Then some girl with a lobotomy has just stolen it, how isn’t it cruel?<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Mrs Greene (The Prom)</b><br>
        Oh, well, at least you aren’t gay<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">JD (Heathers)</b><br>
        I was taught that murder and fear are necessary tools for change and advancement<br>
        <br>

        Jeremy<br>
        I can’t hear a sound out of you<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Veronica</b><br>
        I won’t hear it now<br>
        I won’t hear it now<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Dr Locklear (Dr Locklear creepypasta)</b><br>
        A villain?<br>
        How am I a villain?<br>
        I’m the one stopping villains<br>
        I dismember and murder all villains<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Audrey II (Little House of Horrors)</b><br>
        Oh, Seymour, please go kill someone<br>
        Time for dinner<br>
        <br>
        (Everyone repeats their part)<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Everyone</b><br>
        No, we aren’t villains no, no<br>

        <b class="names">Frisk Dreemurr (Undertale)</b><br>
        There’s more to us than just villains<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Everyone</b><br>
        No we’re not even villains<br>
        <br>
        <b class="names">Frisk Dreemurr</b><br>
        Nobody is simply “a villain”
