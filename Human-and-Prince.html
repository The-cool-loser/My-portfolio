        It ain’t that long ago<br>
        But do you remember<br>
        When we hoped for days of coexistence<br>
        And I thought we can find a way<br>
        To go back up there by today<br>
        And maybe show them signs of our forgiveness<br>
        <br>
        But then that day, still has me shaking<br>
        The day where all our hopes were breaking<br>
        The news spread around fast<br>
        The scars from it still all last<br>
        <br>
        I can't remember if I cried<br>
        When I heard about the murdered child<br>
        But something touched me deep inside<br>
        The day the future died<br>
        <br>
        So rest in peace, our Human and Prince<br>
        Your days underground with us we will all really miss<br>
        And though it brings us pain, we’ll at least reminisce<br>
        For your smiles, laughter and tricks<br>
        You’re for sure the loveliest freaks<br>
        <br>
        When you came, your father said<br>
        To all of us lowly citizens<br>
        With sincere joy in his voice<br>
        “Citizens, just look what joy and love<br>
        Can simple acts of kindness have<br>
        So, let’s open a new era of pure peace”<br>
        <br>
        But I know all things come to an end<br>
        Yet, I still refuse to understand<br>
        You both abruptly died<br>
        With no sign of how or of why<br>
        <br>
        You were sincerely loved by everyone<br>
        Who lives here with you underground<br>
        But on the surface, love’s not found<br>
        The day the future died<br>
        <br>
        That’s why we’re started singing<br> 
        Rest in peace, our Human and Prince<br>
        Your days underground with us we will all really miss<br>
        And though it brings us pain, we’ll at least reminisce<br>
        For your smiles, laughter and tricks<br>
        You’re for sure the loveliest freaks<br>
        <br>
        Now, when we found out we were surprised<br>
        We thought its sign of our new demise<br>
        But I agreed to disagree<br>
        When The King declared our revenge on those<br>
        Who trapped us here and took you both<br>
        There were cheers that came from you and me<br>
        <br>
        But while The King was looking down<br> 
        The Queen threw her crown on the ground<br>
        She left him all alone<br>
        To cry in his ruined home<br>
        <br>
        And since then we’re always on the look<br>
        So far, we’re given all it took<br>
        And 6 of 7 is no joke<br>
        To save the hope that died<br>
        <br>
        Still, we’re singing<br> 
        Rest in peace, our Human and Prince<br>
        Your days underground with us we will all really miss<br>
        And though it brings us pain, we’ll at least reminisce<br>
        For your smiles, laughter and tricks<br>
        You’re for sure the loveliest freaks<br>
        <br>
        Helpers, saviours, we can wait forever<br>
        Knowing one day it will all be better<br>
        Our royals’ minds are built to last<br>
        So we’ll push through our suffering<br>
        For the future they’re offering<br>
        Where we’re leaving all our turmoils in the past<br>
        <br>
        But up in the air, there’s smell of hope<br>
        Our efforts are gonna pay off<br>
        The story may be old<br>
        But it’s still gonna be told<br>
        <br>
        And although our victory is far<br>
        We’re still fighting to cure the scar<br>
        From how our soul was ripped apart<br>
        The day the future dies<br>
        <br>
        We’re still here singing<br>
        Rest in peace, our Human and Prince<br>
        Your days underground with us we will all really miss<br>
        And though it brings us pain, we’ll at least reminisce<br>
        For your smiles, laughter and tricks<br>
        You’re for sure the loveliest freaks<br>
        <br>
        And here we are all in this place<br>
        Where our whole race has been disgraced<br>
        But we all hope to start again<br>
        So come on, everybody, dry those tears<br>
        And learn how to embrace those fears<br>
        And use them as the fuel to fight again<br>
        <br>
        Cause ‘til we watch them pay their due<br>
        We’ll do just what we need to do<br>
        Each child from above<br>
        Will feel the rage we have<br>
        <br>
        And I believe we can turn the page<br>
        And make them be the ones who’re caged<br>
        And up ‘til then we’ll never rest<br>
        Not since our future died<br>
        <br>
        Now we’re singing<br>
        Rest in peace, our Human and Prince<br>
        Your days underground with us we will all really miss<br>
        And though it brings us pain, we’ll at least reminisce<br>
        For your smiles, laughter and tricks<br>
        You’re for sure the loveliest freaks<br>
        <br>
        I met a guard the other day<br>
        And I asked him if he’s not afraid<br>
        And he kneeled down to hug me tight<br>
        I went down to the Waterfall<br>
        Where the captain made her sacred call<br>
        And I’ve just seen a ghost crying out of fright<br>
        <br>
        And in the palace, flowers screamed<br>
        The king was too afraid to dream<br>
        But nothing there felt canny<br>
        Cause dread was felt, and many<br>
        <br>
        And the family that started all<br>
        The one who seemed to crash and fall<br>
        They’re nothing like we can recall<br>
        From when the future died<br>
        <br>
        And they were singing<br>
        Rest in peace, our Human and Prince<br>
        Your days underground with us we will all really miss<br>
        And though it brings us pain, we’ll at least reminisce<br>
        For your smiles, laughter and tricks<br>
        You’re for sure the loveliest freaks<br>
        <br>
        They were singin'<br>
        <br>
        Rest in peace, our Human and Prince<br>
        Your days underground with us we will all really miss<br>
        And though it brings us pain, we’ll at least reminisce<br>
        For your smiles, laughter and tricks<br>
        You’re for sure the loveliest freaks<br>
        <br>
