        <p>
        When I had you, Chara <br>
        Life was filled with so much joy <br>
        Every hour we spent together <br>
        Lives within my heart <br>
        <br>
        We'd bicker around<br>
        And then go on giggling<br>
        And we'd prank each other all the time<br>
        When I had you<br>
        <br>
        From Hotland to Waterfall<br>
        There was noone this wonderful<br>
        And though they all adored me<br>
        With you it was sincere<br>
        <br>
        When my Dad decreed it<br>
        I've never been happier<br>
        Since I knew that I had you<br>
        <br>
        So the years went by<br>
        You had a plan<br>
        But it has come at our expense<br>
        You poisoned yourself<br>
        I was shot and Mommy went<br>
        And Dad was left alone and hopeless<br>
        <br>
        Now a soulless flower<br>
        Growing more and more unhinged<br>
        Without vistages of power<br>
        That I can hold on to<br>
        <br>
        But I had you<br>
        When I had you<br>
        <br>
        When I had you, Chara<br>
        Life was filled with so much joy<br>
        Every hour we spent together<br>
        Lives within my heart<br>
        When I had you<br>
         </p>
