Boom Crash Aaaaah!!!<br>
<br>
Bullets come<br>
From out my screen<br>
<br>
And I stomp<br>
Into the scene<br>
<br>
In crazytown (You fell into danger)<br>
Crazytown (monsters want you to surrender)<br>
Crazytown (But… it’s ain’t no Undertale)<br>
<br>
I am running from a sword as I’m frozen by a small camera<br>
And within it I see sights of my mother crying<br>
(Let him go, let him go, he’s innocent)<br>
And the camera stands on cash, mostly Eastern, but with printed English words<br>
I escape from the scene as I run through a bunch of tunnels<br>
And I realize that this network is what separates the (Bee Dee Deep Bee Dee Deep)<br>
Life from Death<br>
And I’m sinking through the life, which is empty, to the death of the world I’ve known now<br>
And now I’m stuck in<br>
<br>
Crazytown (You’re hiding in vaults now)<br>
Crazytown (Which you’ve getting used to somehow)<br>
Crazytown (But… it’s not your Fallout yet)<br>
<br>
I survive from the stream to discover a hidden closet<br>
And within it I have found a bunch of men in suits<br>
Look at me<br>
As they see<br>
My worn out clothes<br>
They laugh and they wink<br>
Passing money (passing money)<br>
I try to take some<br>
And they look at me with demon eyes<br>
<br>
I gotta go, I gotta get out, gotta go, gotta go, gotta get out, gotta go<br>
<br>
(Hey you, you, please, don’t leave yet)<br>
<br>
And I’ve just found the door<br>
<br>
On the ground next to the door, I see the final key<br>
I open the door with it and another door I see<br>
On the ground next to the door, I see the final key<br>
But when I open the door with it, it’s another door I see<br>
On the ground next to the door, I see the final key<br>
But when I open the door with it, it’s another door I see<br>
On the ground next to the door, I see the final key<br>
But I move door to door to door to door to door and woe is me<br>
And woe is me<br>
And woe is me<br>
And woe is me<br>
And woe is<br>
Crazytown<br>
I’m scared of what I’ll see<br>
Crazytown<br>
Everyone here’s gone crazy<br>
Crazytown<br>
But it ain’t no DDLC<br>
<br>
And I can’t make it out alive (You’ll never outrun them)<br>
And I am chased out by the hive (They hear every door you open)<br>
And in my last remaining five<br>
NO!!<br>
This ain’t no Baldi, or Fallout, or Undertale, Stop<br>
<br>
And I watch from the window as I witness the town on fire<br>
And nobody who’s behind, near or above even find it dire<br>
And the tower explodes<br>
Reaping me apart<br>
Both inside and out<br>
I wake at the start and see<br>
<br>
Me (oh, all frozen in shock)<br>
<br>
I am running from a sword as I’m frozen by a small camera (In the place where we’re all stuck)<br>
<br>
OOOOOOOHHHHH!!!!
