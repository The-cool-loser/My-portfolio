        <h1>Look What You Made Me Do</h1>
        <h2>Original by Taylor Swift</h2>
        <h2>Inspired by Epithet Erased: Prison of Plastic</h2>
        <p>You don't like my little games<br>
        I hate you all the same<br>
        Why must you be so lame?<br>
        You’re so rude<br>
        No, I don't like you<br>
        <br>
        I don’t like your stupid friends<br>
        Ruining my only chance<br>
        Keep doing all you can<br>
        But you’ll see just what I can do<br>
        <br>
        But I got smarter, tougher, rougher with my magic wand<br>
        And yet no matter what I do, I cannot have you gone<br>
        But you’ll stop going once you realize I’ve already won<br>
        You make me mad, and I will make you mud<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        <br>
        I don’t like your selfishness<br>
        What’s “real” is you’re a mess<br>
        And if my patience you will test<br>
        I’ll put you in such distress<br>

        You want to nag and hurt me and be such a bummer. bummer<br>
        But with the world in my hand I know how to make you suffer<br>
        I just wanted to play but you make things hard<br>
        And so I’ll show you who here is more smart<br>
        <br>
        But I got smarter, tougher, rougher with my magic wand<br>
        And yet no matter what I do, I cannot have you gone<br>
        But you’ll stop going once you realize I’ve already won<br>
        You make me mad, and I will make you mud<br>
        <br>  
        Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        <br>
        Don’t know why you hate me but I’ll make them hate you<br>
        The only saving grace you’ll have is these 2<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Don’t know why you hate me but I’ll make them hate you<br>
        The only saving grace you’ll have is these 2<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Don’t know why you hate me but I’ll make them hate you<br>
        The only saving grace you’ll have is these 2<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Don’t know why you hate me but I’ll make them hate you<br>
        The only saving grace you’ll have is these 2<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Aww, are you envious that Dad is always taking my side?<br>
        Well, Maybe it’s because he actually likes me<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you made me do <br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you made me do <br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Ooh, look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
        Look what you just made me do<br>
