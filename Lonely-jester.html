        <p>He-he-he-he-heh<br>
        Yeah, hey (hmm, upwards, upwards)<br>
        <br>
        The role of the bard is a scary one to play<br>
        Cause creative risks might require you to pay<br>
        The role of the bard is a scary one to play<br>
        Even if it will make things awkward all that I aim for is going upwards<br>
        <br>
        Words that inspire fear onto the land<br>
        Will end these clods legacy all with my bare hand<br>
        I’ll take you for a spin and let the wind do the rest<br>
        Yeah, I'll use all the dirty buzzwords<br>
        Whatever it takes to get me upwards, upwards (hmm, upwards upwards)<br>
        <br>
        I was thrown away into the sand<br>
        Called a crazy psycho and almost expelled<br>
        And now it's time to take out my revenge<br>
        I'll shake things out and cause a mess<br>
        ‘Til they become so much less<br>
        Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, yeah! So!<br>
        My plan's to destroy His good reputation<br>
        I'll make them all think he's a plague to his nation<br>
        I WILL MAKE HIM FEAR ME UNTIL HE OBEYS<br>
        I'll become the new kind of our world<br>
        I'll do everything to get me upwards (hmm, upwards, upwards)<br>
        <br>
        You! You were all abandoned by the King!<br>
        For everything<br>
        All the suffrage he allowed<br>
        He will pay for it in blood<br>
        So let's all get together and unite<br>
        <br>
        The role of the bard is a scary one to play<br>
        Cause creative risks might require you to pay<br>
        The role of the bard is a scary one to play<br>
        Even if it will make things awkward all that I aim for is going upwards<br>
        Get powerful<br>
        Get upwards, yeah! (Hmm, upwards, upwards)<br>
